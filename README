OBDGPSLOGGER/OBDSIM

Jure Poljsak:
"What's different here between this fork and gpslogger0.16? This
fork has been hacked so that it doesn't support gpsd and a little
patch was added so that it compiles gui part smoothly(before it did not compile).
It's mainly for using obdsim. That's what I needed, nothing else."

What are the requirements?
You may need to install gpsd for it to compile, but gps is disabled in it.
The GUI component requires FLTK and fluid.


How do I build this?

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install

And how do I run it?

obdsim -g gui_fltk
